### Short story ###
The first version is a “sauces gallery” allowing users to upload their favorite hot sauces and like or dislike sauces that others share. The front-end of the application was developed using Angular and was precompiled after internal testing, and we developed the back-end to build the API, while paying attention to the requirements for security (all user passwords collected by the application are protected).
